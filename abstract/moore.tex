\section*{Introduction}
%
Recent research and commercial activity have shown that gait related powered
prosthetics will play an important role in assisting humans with disabilities.
These devices include a variety of sensors and actuators than can be coupled by
a control system to provide gait assistance. In particular, there are light
weight lower extremity exoskeletons on the market that assist in walking but
lack gait that resembles that of an able-bodied human. Our intent is to
identify a simple linear controller from a large set of data collected from
able-bodied walkers perturbed with random longitudinal and/or lateral forces
with powered prosthetic applications in mind.
%
\section*{Methods}
Herein we present results from data collected from a single subject (age: 25,
mass: 101 kg, height: 187 cm) walking around 1.2 m/s on a treadmill (ForceLink
R-Mill) while being longitudinally perturbed, i.e. a random white noise with
5\% std around the nominal belt speed. We collect data for four minutes at 100
Hz which includes about 200 steps. We compute the ankle plantarflexion, knee
flexion, and hip flexion angles, rates, and moments using 2D inverse dynamics.

\end{figure}

We section the joint angle, rate, and torque time series into steps based on
the right foot's heel strike and interpolate 20 evenly spaced data points from
each series along the gait cycle. We assume a simple scheduled proportional
derivative controller that generates the joint torques given the joint angles
and rates that fits the following form for a single gait cycle.
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{m}_m(\varphi) = \mathbf{m}^*(\varphi) -
  \mathbf{K}(\varphi)\mathbf{s}_m(\varphi)
\end{equation}
%
where $\varphi$ is the time in the right leg gait cycle,
$\mathbf{m}_m(\varphi)$ is a vector of measured joint torques,
$\mathbf{m}^*(\varphi)$ is a vector of the reference joint torques,
$\mathbf{K}(\varphi)$ is the scheduled gain matrix which multiplies the vector
of measured angles and rates, $\mathbf{s}_m(\varphi)$. This equation is linear
in gains and the reference torques. Given enough measured data, the reference
torques and the gains can be solved for using linear least squares. The
externally applied perturbations are critical for reducing the uncertainty in
the identified parameters.
\section*{Results}
%
Here we show an example result from a controller structure which is limited to
joint torque generation only from error in the sensors from that same joint.
Figure \ref{fig:gains} shows the estimates of the scheduled gains with respect
to the percent gait cycle in each leg. Figure \ref{fig:fit} shows an example
prediction of the measured ankle plantarflexion torque in the right leg by the
identified control model.

\section*{Discussion}
%
We are able to identify a simple linear controller that exhibits larger gains
in the stance phase than in the swing phase and there is indication of similar
gain patterns in the right and left legs. The controller is also able to
predict the measured joint torques with greater than 60\% VAF in all joints.
