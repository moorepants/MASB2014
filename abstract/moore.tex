\section*{Introduction}
%
Recent research and commercial activity have shown that gait-related, powered
prosthetics will play an important role in assisting humans with disabilities.
These devices include a variety of sensors and actuators than can be coupled by
a control system to provide gait assistance. However, the available lightweight, 
lower extremity exoskeletons lack gait that resembles an able-bodied human. To improve
the gait of powered prosthetics, our intent is to identify a simple, linear controller 
from a large set of data collected from able-bodied subjects being perturbed by random
longitudinal and/or lateral forces.
%
\section*{Methods}
Data was collected from a single subject (age: 25, mass: 101 kg, height: 187 cm)
walking on instrumented treadmill (VG005-A, Motek Medical, Amsterdam, Netherlands). 
The subject was longitudinally perturbed using a random white noise with 5\% std 
around a nominal 1.2 m/s belt speed. Data was recorded for 4 minutes at 100
Hz, which included approximately 200 steps of walking. Ankle plantarflexion, knee 
flexion, and hip flexion angles, rates, and moments were computed using 2D inverse
dynamics.

\end{figure}

Joint angle, rate, and torque time series were sectioned into steps based on
the right foot's heel strike.  Subsequently, 20 evenly spaced data points from
each series were interpolated along the gait cycle. We assume a simple scheduled 
proportional derivative controller that generates the joint torques given the joint
angles and rates that fits the following form.
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{m}(t) = \mathbf{m}^*(\varphi(t)) -
  \mathbf{K}(\varphi(t))\mathbf{s}(t)
\end{equation}
%
where $t$ is an instance of time, $\varphi(t)$ is the phase in the right leg
gait cycle, $\mathbf{m}(t)$ is a vector of joint torques,
$\mathbf{m}^*(\varphi(t))$ is a vector of the reference joint torques,
$\mathbf{K}(\varphi(t))$ is the gait phase scheduled gain matrix which
multiplies the vector of joint angles and rates, $\mathbf{s}(t)$. This equation
is linear in the gains and the reference torques. Given sufficient joint angle,
rate, and torque measurements, the reference torques and the gains can be
solved for using linear least squares.
\section*{Results}
%
Here we present an example result from a controller structure which is limited to
joint torque generation only from error in the sensors from the same joint.
Figure \ref{fig:gains} shows the estimates of the scheduled gains with respect
to the percent gait cycle in each leg. Figure \ref{fig:fit} demonstrates an example
prediction of the measured ankle plantarflexion torque in the right leg by the
identified control model.

\section*{Discussion}
%
We are able to identify a simple linear controller that exhibits larger gains
in the stance phase than in the swing phase.  Additionally, similar
gain patterns in the right and left legs are observed. The controller is capable
of predicting the measured joint torques with greater than 60\% VAF in all joints.
